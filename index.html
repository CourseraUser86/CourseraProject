<h1>Top 5 Craziest Animal Moments Caught On Camera!</h1>
<p>As shocking as this might seem, animals are not always cute, innocent creatures that want to coinhabit the<br>
earth with humans. Soon, you will come to find that some of these animals seek to cause only chaos and <br>
destruction, threatening all civilization as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>The follwing information may be too scary to accept, therefore reader/viewer discretion is advised.</strong></p>
</header>
<p>Here is a list of all the crazy animals caught on camera:</p>
<ol><li>Aggressive penguin becomes a surface-to-air missle</li><li>Crow has a cigarette in its mouth</li><li>Fish drinking someone's drink</li><li>Dog gets pulled over by a cop</li><li>Cat sits in a tank</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Description:&nbsp;</i>Absolutely horrifying! An aggressive penguin intimidates a poor bystander,
<br>and when they slip and fall through the ice, the penguin immediately activates its hidden
<br>solid-state rocket boosters, shoots upwards, and proceeds to dive strait towards its
<br>helpless prey.</p>

<img src="crow_smoking.jpeg" alt="Crow with a cigarette in its beak" style="width:285px">
<p><i>Description:&nbsp;</i>We tend to think that animals want to preserve our earth's health just as much
<br>as humans do. However, some do not. Look at this example of the crow; it is clearly
<br>demonstrating how much it hates the environment by smoking a cigarette. Clearly, it's goal
<br>is to raise the carbon footprint of the earth, which will heat up our atmosphere, causing our
<br>polar ice caps to melt, causing our oceans to rise.. All in an effort to put our coastlines 
<br>underwater!</p>

<p><i>Description:&nbsp;</i>Have you ever wondered why the global supply of fresh water is dwindling? Here
<br>is one (of many) culprits responsible! This fish boarded a civilian's boat, demanded to be fed
<br>the person's water, threatened to capsize the boat (which I cannot empirically confirm because I
<br>cannot speak fish, but I imagine that's what it said), and then proceeded to drink the water,
<br>before quickly retreating into the waters. This is just one example of how our freshwater
<br>supply is being taken away.

<img src="dog_driving.avif" alt="Dog gets pulled over by a cop" style="width:285px">
<p><i>Description:&nbsp;</i>This image captures the brave moment a police officer pulls over a
<br>reckless dog driving a hypercar. Moments before this picture was taken, the officer and
<br>canine were engaged in a life or death, high speed chase down the interstate. The officer
<br>was thankfully able to get the dog to stop, by promising a bag of doggy treats. Unaware of
<br>the trickery, the dog slowed down and pulled over. And that is when this image was taken.
<br>Why was the dog driving recklessly? How did it get a hypercar? The answer? We may
<br>never know. But, we must never think for a moment that the dog isn't part of <i>the</i>
<br>global effort to supercede the human race.
</p>
<br>
<img src="cat_in_tank.jpg" alt="Cat in a tank" style="width:285px">
<p><i>Description:&nbsp;</i>As we have seen in these examples, more and more animals are beginning
<br>to reject the social hiearchy that places humans on top. In this last example, I hope to truly
<br>highlight the danger we humans are in. In this image, a bystander happened to witness a cat
<br>hijacking a tank. What the cat planned on doing with the tank is still unknown. According
<br>to eyewitness testimony, the cat had managed to start the tank, but seeing a bystander
<br>taking pictures, quickly abandoned the vehicle. Its motives, while unclear, should
<br>not be underestimated. With such firepower, the cat could have caused serious damage!
